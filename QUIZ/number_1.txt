1. Consider the following page reference string: 1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 3, 1, 6, 2. 
All frames are initially empty, so the first unique pages will always be a page fault.
The frame allocation is 4 and the replacement algorithm is FIFO.
How many page fault(s) would occur?

The answer should be written as an empty file (the answer IS the filename),
and the filename must follow the given format below:

W05Q11_AkunGithub_ReplacementAlgorithm_NumberofPageFaults

example:
W05Q11_aceyoga_FIFO_999
